# Notion Layout - Chrome Extension
## What is it?
Chrome Extension that makes viewing Notion database pages better!

Features:
  - Auto-hides page properties list that often pushes down the page content.
  - Adds a button to hide page content as well.
  - Reorder comment section to the bottom of the page.
  - Removes the annoying overlay that obscures videos.
  - Makes page previews larger to waste less screen space.

## How it works?
By default list of properties is collapsed:             |  Clicking on the button opens/hides the list of properties and/or page content:
