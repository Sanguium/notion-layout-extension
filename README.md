# Notion Layout - Chrome Extension
## What is it?
Chrome Extension that makes viewing Notion database pages better!

It auto-hides page properties list that often pushes down the page content.

## How it works?
By default list of properties is collapsed:             |  Clicking on the bar opens/hides the list of properties:
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![collapsed](https://github.com/alexander-kazakov/notion-layout-extension/raw/master/images/collapsed.png)  |  ![uncollapsed](https://github.com/alexander-kazakov/notion-layout-extension/raw/master/images/uncollapsed.png)

## Hiding the comments seciton
The extension also permanently hides the comments section - great for personal Notion users. 
If you still want to see comments, simply delete everything in styles.css file.

## How to install?
1. Download the whole repo as Zip file (see green button "Code" in top right of this page)
2. Open Chrome Extension chrome://extensions
3. Enable "Developer Mode" (top right)
4. Unzip the downloaded folder
5. Drag & drop the unzipped folder into Chrome extensions window

## Safety
This is a simple extension with <2 pages of code. You can read it entirely to make sure it is safe.

## Notice
I wrote it in an afternoon for myself and sharing with the community. It is not affiliated with Notion the company.
